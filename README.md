# iHaveCrabs

This game was made over the course of 4 months as a part of the Northwest Missouri State University Foundations of Game Development class. It was contributed to by Daniel Crowley, Phillip Lyons, and Turbo Mair.

iHaveCrabs is a Dungeon-Crawler style game. you are placed at the center of the map with a Sword and Bow as your available weapons. One of the 4 rooms adjacent to the center will be open with some crabs for you to take out. Once you have taken out all of the crabs in this room, all rooms adjacent to the cleared room will become available to enter and clear out.

When you clear a room, a card will spawn in the center of the room. You can equip this card to affect your health points, your weapon damage, and various global variables such as Enemy Speed and Health Points. Cards with a Star rarity can only be placed in the darkened card slot, while all other rarities are available to place in the other 3 card slots for a total of 4 active cards.

There are 2 main types of crab enemies. The first is a simple crab that will be in any color of the rainbow. You need to watch out for their pinchers, as they will hurt you. The second type of crab is a "Crab with Hat". These crabs will shoot fireballs at the player. Hat Crabs have less health than the Simple Crabs.

Once all of the rooms have been completely cleared out, King Reginald will spawn. He is a massive Hat Crab with significantly increased hit points. He will not be affected by cards that change global variables.

When you defeat the King of the Crabs, you will be asked if you wish to try again or quit the game.

This was a simple game demo designed to help us learn the basic principles of game design, while also express our creativity.
